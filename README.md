# Java Spring microservice

In this sample application, you will create a basic Java web application using Spring. This provides a starting point for creating Java microservice applications running on [Spring](https://spring.io/). It contains no default application code, but comes with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring.

Capabilities are provided through dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. The ports are set to the defaults of `8080` for http and `8443` for https and are exposed to the CLI in the `cli-config.yml` file. The ports are set in the `pom.xml` file and exposed to the CLI in the `cli-config.yml` file.

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?starterKit=1298bc4e-4764-390b-a9eb-e4dcf3cc03ad) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying 

After you have created a new git repo from this git template, remember to rename the project.
Edit `settings.gradle` and change the `rootProject.name` from the default name to the name you used to create the template.

Make sure you are logged into the IBM Cloud using the IBM Cloud CLI and have access 
to you development cluster. If you are using OpenShift make sure you have logged into OpenShift CLI on the command line.

```$bash
npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli
```

Use the IBM Garage for Cloud CLI to register the GIT Repo with Jenkins 
```$bash
igc pipeline -n dev
```

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 11: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 11 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)
    
To build and run an application:
1. `./gradlew build`
2. `./gradlew bootRun`


## More Details

For more details on how to use this Starter Kit Template please review the [IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools Developer Guide](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/)

### Periodically update from the template

Finally, the template components can be periodically updated by running the following:

```bash
./update-template.sh
```
